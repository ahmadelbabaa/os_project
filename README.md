### Project Proposal: Football Stadium Food and drink Sales Simulation

Simulation Idea:
The simulation aims to model the food and drink sales operations within a football stadium during a live match. It will simulate the interactions between concession stands and spectators, focusing on the process of selling food and beverages to spectators attending the match.

Real-World Relevance:
Food and drink sales are a crucial aspect of stadium operations during sporting events. Efficient management of concession stands and sales transactions is essential to provide a positive experience for spectators while maximising revenue for the stadium.

Problem to Solve:
The simulation addresses the challenge of optimising food and drink sales operations within a football stadium. By simulating the interactions between concession stands and spectators, the simulation aims to improve the efficiency of food sales, reduce wait times for spectators, and maximise revenue for the stadium.
